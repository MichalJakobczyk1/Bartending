            The art of bartending has been around for thousands of years. While
            it has evolved drastically from when the profession first began, it

            Bartending can be traced back to ancient times in Rome, Greece, and
            Asia. In fact, there is a recorded history of bartending dating back
            to when Julius Caesar ruled Ancient Rome. Along popularly traveled
            routes, travelers could find public drinking houses where they could
            relax, socialize, and enjoy a glass of wine before continuing on to
            their destination. Residents of Rome could also find these public
            drinking houses in their towns, so it wasn’t just travelers who
            could sip on finely crafted wine. Even earlier than the Roman
            Empire, the Ancient Greeks set up taverns where patrons could
            socialize and enjoy a drink poured by craftsmen while being
            entertained by a play or music.

            During the Middle Ages, bartending was a full profession. Bartenders
            were usually innkeepers or women who would brew their own drinks,
            such as wine and mead. During the 15th Century, these bartenders
            were seen as part of the social elite class because they were able
            to own property from the money they made through serving alcohol.
            The public drinking houses of Ancient times soon turned into taverns
            and pubs (especially in England) where patrons could gather and
            gossip. At this point in the history of bartending, bartenders
            became status symbols and familiar with their clientele.

            With the discovery of the New World, Europeans made sure to bring
            over the practice of bartending. Similar to the drinking culture in
            England, taverns and pubs opened up in the Colonies. It wasn’t until
            a few centuries after the discovery of America that bartending would
            be completely revamped. Jeremiah “Jerry” Thomas (1830-1885) became
            known as the Father of American Mixology. He learned how to bartend
            in New Haven, Connecticut before going to California during the Gold
            Rush. It was when he arrived in Europe that he amazed bartenders
            with his flashy moves and carefully planned proportions of mixed
            drinks. Thomas also wrote and published the first drink book in the
            United States, How to Mix Drinks.

            bartenders and mixologists in the history of bartending. Many
            bartenders were left without jobs. Others decided to open up
            speakeasies and brew their own alcohol, such as bathtub gin. While
            alcohol may have been banned, that didn’t stop Americans from
            drinking and producing it.

            as well as how to keep patrons satisfied. Large bartending
            competitions are held each year with flashy tricks and movements to
            entertain guests. The history of bartending starts with a basic
            duty, to refresh travelers on ancient roads. It then evolved for
            bartenders to become part of the elite class where they provided a
            place patrons to socialize. It was in the New World that bartending
            gained such important, especially during the Prohibition era. Now,
            bartending is an art and trade that has engraved itself into our
            culture.

              A cocktail strainer is a metal bar accessory used to remove ice from a mixed drink as it is poured into the serving glass. A type of sieve, the strainer is placed over the mouth of the glass or shaker in which the beverage was prepared; small holes in the device allow only liquids to pass as the beverage is poured.

              There are two common types of strainers. The Hawthorne strainer is a disc (called the "rim") with a handle and two or more stabilizing prongs. A metal spring fixed around the edge of the rim rolls inward to fit inside the glass. The rim of the strainer does not need to touch the rim of the glass, as the spring inside filters out the ice.
              
              The Julep strainer is shaped like a bowl with a handle, and will fit tightly into a mixing glass or shaker when inserted at the proper angle. Liquid passes through holes or slits in the bowl.

              A bartending spoon is a long-handled spoon used in bartending for mixing and layering of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic mixed drinks. Its length ensures that it can reach the bottom of the tallest jug or tumbler to mix ingredients directly in the glass.

A bar spoon holds about 5 millilitres of liquid (the same as a conventional teaspoon). Its long handle is similar to an iced tea spoon, but is usually decorative and elegant some variations mimic large swizzle sticks, with a disc at one end. The shaft is typically thin and threaded so that the fingers can easily grip and rotate the spoon.

              A jigger, also known as a measure, is a bartending tool used to measure liquor, which is typically then poured into a glass or cocktail shaker.

              The term jigger in the sense of a small cup or measure of spirits or wine originates in the U.S. in the early 19th century. Many references from the 1800s describe the "jigger boss" providing jiggers of whiskey to Irish immigrant workers who were digging canals in the U.S. Northeast.
              
              The style of double-ended jigger common today, made of stainless steel with two unequal sized opposing cones in an hourglass shape, was patented in 1893 by Cornelius Dungan of Chicago. Typically, one cone measures a regulation single shot, and the other some fraction or multiple—with the actual sizes depending on local laws and customs.
              
              A contemporary jigger measure in the U.S. usually holds 1.5 US fluid ounces (44 ml), while the jiggers used in the U.K. are typically 25 ml or sometimes 35 ml. Jiggers may also hold other amounts and ratios, and can vary depending on the region and date of manufacture.
              
              In the U.S. up until Prohibition, a jigger was commonly known to be about half a gill, or 2 US fluid ounces (59 ml), but starting in the latter part of the 20th century, it is typically interpreted to be 1.5 US fluid ounces (44 ml).
